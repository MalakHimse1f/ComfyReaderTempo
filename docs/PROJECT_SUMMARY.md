# ComfyReaderTempo Project Summary

## Project Overview

ComfyReaderTempo is a modern web application built with React and TypeScript that provides a comfortable reading experience for digital documents. The application allows users to upload, manage, and read documents with customizable reading preferences. The project uses Supabase for backend functionality including authentication and document storage.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
- **Backend/Database**: Supabase
- **Deployment**: Configured for Netlify deployment
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth

## Core Features

### Authentication

- **User Registration**: New users can sign up with email and password
- **User Login**: Existing users can sign in with their credentials
- **Protected Routes**: Dashboard and document management features require authentication
- **Auth Context**: Provides authentication state throughout the application

### Document Library

- **Document Management**: Users can view, upload, delete, and organize their documents
- **Search Functionality**: Search through document titles
- **View Modes**: Toggle between grid and list views for document organization
- **Document Preview**: Card-based interface showing document metadata (file type, size, upload date)

### Document Reader

- **Reading Experience**: Clean, focused interface for reading documents
- **Customization Options**:
  - Font size adjustment
  - Font family selection
  - Line spacing control
  - Margin adjustment
  - Dark/light mode toggle
- **Document Navigation**: Navigate back to the document library
- **Actions**: Bookmark, download, and share functionality

### User Interface

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes
- **Navigation**: Top navigation bar and sidebar for core application features
- **Modern UI Components**: Using shadcn/ui library components for a cohesive look and feel

## Current State

The application currently features:

1. A complete authentication flow using Supabase
2. A document library with mock document data
3. A document reader with customization options
4. Basic navigation between views
5. Responsive UI for various device sizes

## Implementation Details

### Authentication

Authentication is implemented using Supabase Auth with React Context for state management:

- `AuthProvider` manages authentication state and provides methods for sign-in, sign-up, and sign-out
- `useAuth` hook gives components access to authentication functionality
- Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users

### Document Management

The document system currently uses mock data for demonstration but is structured to easily connect with Supabase backend:

- `DocumentLibrary` component provides an interface for viewing and managing documents
- `DocumentCard` displays individual document information
- `DocumentUpload` component enables file uploads (currently client-side only)

### Reading Experience

The application offers a robust document reading experience:

- `DocumentReader` provides a clean reading interface
- User preferences for reading are stored in component state
- The interface offers customization options to improve reading comfort

## Deployment

The project is configured for easy deployment to Netlify with:

- `netlify.toml` configuration file that includes:
  - Build commands and output directory
  - SPA redirect rules
  - Environment configurations
  - Security headers
  - Cache settings for static assets

## Next Steps

Based on the current implementation, potential next steps could include:

1. Implementing actual document storage in Supabase
2. Adding document content parsing for various formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
3. Implementing user preferences persistence
4. Adding collaboration features
5. Improving offline functionality
