This is a placeholder file for the EPUB test fixtures directory.

In a real testing environment, you would place actual EPUB files here for testing.
For example:
- sample-book.epub
- empty-book.epub
- corrupted-book.epub

These files would be used by the test suite to verify the EPUB processing functionality.
